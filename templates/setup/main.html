<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>I am thinking a full page wizard that will allow the admin to setup the catalog initially. This should allow them to connect and import the global catalog. It should also allow them to add their own providers and services.</p>
<p>What is the information needed to connect to the global catalog? What is the information need to add services and providers?</p>
